                <h2>Hi there! I'm {{ student.name }}</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a dedicated Artificial Intelligence and Data Science student currently enrolled at 
                    <strong>{{ student.college }}</strong>, pursuing my engineering degree from 
                    {{ student.academic_period }}. My journey in technology began with a curiosity 
                    about how things work, and it has evolved into a passion for creating meaningful 
                    solutions through code.

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic career, I've been exploring various domains of computer 
                    science, from web development to algorithms and data structures. Each project 
                    I work on teaches me something new and helps me grow as a developer and problem-solver.
